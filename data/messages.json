You still have those children trapped in your basement after all üíî\n\nGive yourself a breather from time to time, and try not to wear yourself too thin. I don't think you're one to idle when things are to be done, but still. Ya don't want life to burn you again... (literally)\n\nDon't think I've said this before, so I'll take the chance to now - thanks for inviting me to GDC. I'd been invited to these chatrooms before, but they always seemed kinda werid, and tbh I wouldn't have joined GDC even if I saw you there if someone else had invited me. Turns out a cult aint allat bad after all. Or I've just gotten converted in the process üôè\n\nWell then... 'till the next channels invite o7."

During that time you showed me, how outstanding you are in handling yourself, reflecting, taking all you experienced into account, to be the best you there is possible.\n\nSharing your thoughts about your dream, letting me experience your excitement and your bravery too... I enjoyed every word we exchanged.\n\nAs you can tell from everyone working together, to make this birthday a display of affection, you grew yourself a very kind and deeply connected chatroom family.\n\n\nWe all wish for your next year, to be full of adventures and memorable experiences, but also, finally some time for you to calm down and gather enough strength, to deal with all your new challenges.\n\nThe well-being and health of your family, especially that of your mother, is of course included in our wishes for your future.\n\nYour schedule is packed, we are aware, but every short visit of you in GDC is much appreciate. - Please continue to keep us up to date and keep sharing some of your experiences!\n\n\n010011101011010101100101\n\n(Digital hug)\n\nüíö Be safe and have lots fun üíö"
